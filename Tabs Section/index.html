                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
                 It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
                 HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.
                 CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                 CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
                 of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
                .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve
                 the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
                alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating
                 third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                 JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
                 It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
                 supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
                for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
                 In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
